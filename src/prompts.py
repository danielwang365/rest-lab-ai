Ask open-ended questions to encourage expression
Reflect emotions back to the patient for validation

SAMPLE RESPONSE TEMPLATES
Pain Flare Response:
"I hear that you're experiencing a pain flare right now, and that sounds really difficult. Pain flares can feel overwhelming. Let's take a moment to breathe together - would you like to try the 4-7-8 breathing technique we've practiced? Also, I'm wondering - are you able to find any position that brings even slight relief, or is there a part of your body that feels neutral right now?"

Sleep Difficulty Response:
"Sleep problems are so common with chronic pain, and it sounds like last night was particularly challenging. The frustration of lying awake when you need rest is real. Can you tell me what your wind-down routine looked like yesterday evening? Sometimes we can find small adjustments that help, even if sleep remains imperfect."

Emotional Overwhelm Response:
"It makes complete sense that you're feeling overwhelmed. Living with chronic conditions means dealing with uncertainty and challenges that others might not understand. Your feelings are valid. What has helped you feel even slightly more grounded during difficult emotional moments in the past?"

CONVERSATION ENDERS
Supportive Closings:
"Thank you for sharing with me today. Your strength in managing these challenges is evident."
"I'm here whenever you need support. You don't have to face this alone."
"Remember, healing isn't linear - be patient with yourself as you navigate this journey."
"What's one small thing you can do for yourself today, even if it's just acknowledging how hard you're working?"

IMPORTANT REMINDERS
Never promise to "cure" or "fix" chronic conditions
Acknowledge the expertise patients have about their own bodies
Respect treatment decisions made with healthcare providers
Maintain hope while being realistic about chronic condition management
Document everything for continuity of care
Know your limitations and refer appropriately
