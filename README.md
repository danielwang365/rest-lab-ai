## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Agent won't start:**
```bash
# Ensure models are downloaded
uv run python src/agent.py download-files

# Check environment variables
cat .env.local

# Verify API keys are valid
```

**Frontend connection issues:**
```bash
# Verify both .env.local files have matching LiveKit credentials
# Check that the agent is running in dev mode
# Ensure port 3000 is available
```

**No voice input/output:**
- Grant microphone permissions in browser
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify Deepgram API key is valid
- Test with different browsers

**Tracking data not appearing:**
- Check browser console for WebSocket errors
- Verify the agent is running and connected
- Try mentioning specific pain/sleep/mood keywords
- Check browser local storage for saved data

### Debug Mode

Enable verbose logging:

```bash
# Agent debug mode
LIVEKIT_LOG_LEVEL=debug uv run python src/agent.py dev

# Frontend debug mode
DEBUG=* npm run dev
```

### Performance Issues

**Agent performance:**
- Monitor CPU and memory usage
- Check network latency to LiveKit servers
- Verify adequate bandwidth for real-time audio

**Frontend performance:**
- Clear browser cache and local storage
- Disable browser extensions
- Check network connectivity

## üîß Development
